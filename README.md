# PS5-bd-j-java-project
PS5 bd-j java cyber security project 

Hi, this is Mitchell Shone  and I'm a lead maintainer of this project.

FirstBDJApp.java    is my first java application which can be used with the HD COOKBOOK and JAVA SDK designed to output a simple string to the tv from the PS5

A Collection of .iso homebrew games pre built with imgburn from folders ready to be tested i found from information regarding ps3 bd-j can be used on ps4 and ps5 also

can be burnt to a blueray bd-r or bd-re disc 

More to be added soon inc log4j , Testing Malware in the PS5 Sandbox , JAVA Malware , Crypto JAVA Mining

updated hello world application
updated included a ps5 ddos python script for stress testing ps5 network


UPDATE ! ! ! ! most of this unfortunately ended towards end of december 2023 due to sony patching out some of the bd-j exploits on later firmware versions ! ! ! ! !
